# Strengthening My CSS Foundations 💪

Just completed the CSS Flexbox course on Scrimba!

Working with React and modern UI libraries, it's easy to take layout utilities for granted. But revisiting the fundamentals reminded me why Flexbox revolutionized web layouts. The control it gives over alignment, spacing, and responsiveness is unmatched.

Covered main axis vs cross axis, justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap, and the flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis properties for fine-grained control.

Back to basics sometimes means moving forward faster 🚀
